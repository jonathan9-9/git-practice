## Getting started


We will be doing some git practice by trying out some git commands with the repo you have cloned.

This is a checkpoint...


If at any point you have forgot the commands, check out the notion or search google.



## **Exercise 1: Make a merge request and merge the changes into main**

1. Make a new branch called "**task/exercise-1**"

2. Create a file called "**journal.txt**".

3. In journal.txt, copy the following lines:

		Step 1: Clone your repository
		Step 2: Learn git today from the exercises in this readme
		Step 3: Profit

4. Once the file is created with the copied text, stage your changes in the "**task/exercise-1**" branch

5. Commit all your changes

6. Push your changes onto gitlab

7. Make a merge request on gitlab

8. Merge your changes into main. You can squash the commit and delete the branch in this case.



**

## Exercise 2: Resolving a merge conflict

**

1. Pull the latest changes from **main**
2. Run `sh merge.sh` if you are on a mac or run `.\merge.ps1` if you are on windows
3. Resolve the merge conflict by choosing the current changes
4. Make a merge request towards main
5. Merge the merge request
